This is a fascinating problem though I couldn't solve it.$\ $ :surrender:
Here is the list of positive numbers $x$ (up to 300,000) satisfying the condition. (With composite numbers colored red, primes blue)
Comments: I wonder if there are any other peculiarities of this interesting sequence of $x$. :read:
